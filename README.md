# End-to-end-ml-systems-on-aws-sagemaker

A complete end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) pipeline is built on (Amazon SageMaker studio)
[https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/]. The pipeline comprises the complete pipelines of
data pre-processing, training and hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation and registry,
deploying and monitoring.

This repository paves a framework template to develop a production ready
scalable ML systems that stores data in amazon S3 bucket, train and tune models, and
monitor systems that are already in production.
