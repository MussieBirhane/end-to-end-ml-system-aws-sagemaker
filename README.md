# End-to-end-ml-systems-on-aws-sagemaker

A complete Machine Learning (ML) pipeline is built on [Amazon SageMaker studio] (https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). The pipeline comprises data pre-processing,
training and hyperparameter tuning, deploying and monitoring.

This repository paves a framework template to develop a production ready
scalable ML systems that stores data in amazon S3, train and tune models, and
monitor systems that are already in production.
